Say, your favorite restaurant is right around the corner. If you go there every day, you would be confident of what you will get, but miss the chances of discovering an even better option. If you try new places all the time, very likely you are gonna have to eat unpleasant food from time to time. Similarly, online advisors try to balance between the known most attractive ads and the new ads that might be even more successful. </p><p><img src="/.com//exploration_vs_exploitation.png" alt="bernoulli bandit"><br><em>Fig. 1. A real-life example of the exploration vs exploitation dilemma: where to eat? (Image source: UC Berkeley AI course <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_slides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slide</a>, <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/slides/Lecture%2011%20--%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20II/SP14%20CS188%20Lecture%2011%20--%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20II.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lecture 11</a>.)</em></p><p>If we have learned all the information about the environment, we are able to find the best strategy by even just simulating brute-force, let alone many other smart approaches. The dilemma comes from the <em>incomplete</em> information: we need to gather enough information to make best overall decisions while keeping the risk under control. With exploitation, we take advantage of the best option we know. With exploration, we take some risk to collect information about unknown options. The best long-term strategy may involve short-term sacrifices. For example, one exploration trial could be a total failure, but it warns us of not taking that action too often in the future.</p><h2><span id="what-is-multi-armed-bandit">What is Multi-Armed Bandit?</span><a href="#what-is-multi-armed-bandit" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-armed bandit</a> problem is a classic problem that well demonstrates the exploration vs exploitation dilemma. Imagine you are in a casino facing multiple slot machines and each is configured with an unknown probability of how likely you can get a reward at one play. The question is: <em>What is the best strategy to achieve highest long-term rewards?</em></p><p>In this post, we will only discuss the setting of having an infinite number of trials. The restriction on a finite number of trials introduces a new type of exploration problem. For instance, if the number of trials is smaller than the number of slot machines, we cannot even try every machine to estimate the reward probability (!) and hence we have to behave smartly w.r.t. a limited set of knowledge and resources (i.e. time).</p><p><em>Fig. 2. An illustration of how a Bernoulli multi-armed bandit works. The reward probabilities are <strong>unknown</strong> to the player.</em></p><p>A naive approach can be that you continue to playing with one machine for many many rounds so as to eventually estimate the “true” reward probability according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law of large numbers</a>. However, this is quite wasteful and surely does not guarantee the best long-term reward.</p><h3><span id="definition">Definition</span><a href="#definition" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Now let’s give it a scientific definition. </p><p>A Bernoulli multi-armed bandit can be described as a tuple of <script type="math/tex">\langle \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R} \rangle</script>, where:</p><ul><li>We have <script type="math/tex">K</script> machines with reward probabilities, <script type="math/tex">\{ \theta_1, \dots, \theta_K \}</script>.</li><li>At each time step t, we take an action a on one slot machine and receive a reward r.</li><li><script type="math/tex">\mathcal{A}</script> is a set of actions, each referring to the interaction with one slot machine. The value of action a is the expected reward, <script type="math/tex">Q(a) = \mathbb{E} [r \vert a] = \theta</script>. If action <script type="math/tex">a_t</script> at the time step t is on the i-th machine, then <script type="math/tex">Q(a_t) = \theta_i</script>.</li><li><script type="math/tex">\mathcal{R}</script> is a reward function. In the case of Bernoulli bandit, we observe a reward r in a <em>stochastic</em> fashion. At the time step t, <script type="math/tex">r_t = \mathcal{R}(a_t)</script> may return reward 1 with a probability <script type="math/tex">Q(a_t)</script> or 0 otherwise.</li></ul><p>It is a simplified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov decision process</a>, as there is no state <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{S}</script>.</p><p>The goal is to maximize the cumulative reward <script type="math/tex">\sum_{t=1}^T r_t</script>.<br>If we know the optimal action with the best reward, then the goal is same as to minimize the potential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regret_(decision_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regret</a>) or loss by not picking the optimal action.</p><p>The optimal reward probability <script type="math/tex">\theta^{*}</script> of the optimal action <script type="math/tex">a^{*}</script> is:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta^{*}=Q(a^{*})=\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q(a) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq K} \theta_i</script><p>Our loss function is the total regret we might have by not selecting the optimal action up to the time step T:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{L}_T = \mathbb{E} \Big[ \sum_{t=1}^T \big( \theta^{*} - Q(a_t) \big) \Big]</script><h3><span id="bandit-strategies">Bandit Strategies</span><a href="#bandit-strategies" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Based on how we do exploration, there several ways to solve the multi-armed bandit.</p><ul><li>No exploration: the most naive approach and a bad one.</li><li>Exploration at random</li><li>Exploration smartly with preference to uncertainty</li></ul><h2><span id="e-greedy-algorithm">ε-Greedy Algorithm</span><a href="#e-greedy-algorithm" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The ε-greedy algorithm takes the best action most of the time, but does random exploration occasionally. The action value is estimated according to the past experience by averaging the rewards associated with the target action a that we have observed so far (up to the current time step t):</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{Q}_t(a) = \frac{1}{N_t(a)} \sum_{\tau=1}^t r_\tau \mathbb{1}[a_\tau = a]</script><p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{1}</script> is a binary indicator function and <script type="math/tex">N_t(a)</script> is how many times the action a has been selected so far, <script type="math/tex">N_t(a) = \sum_{\tau=1}^t \mathbb{1}[a_\tau = a]</script>.</p><p>According to the ε-greedy algorithm, with a small probability <script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script> we take a random action, but otherwise (which should be the most of the time, probability 1-<script type="math/tex">\epsilon</script>) we pick the best action that we have learnt so far: <script type="math/tex">\hat{a}^{*}_t = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \hat{Q}_t(a)</script>. </p><p>Check my toy implementation <a href="https://github.com/lilianweng/multi-armed-bandit/blob/master/solvers.py#L45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h2><span id="upper-confidence-bounds">Upper Confidence Bounds</span><a href="#upper-confidence-bounds" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Random exploration gives us an opportunity to try out options that we have not known much about. However, due to the randomness, it is possible we end up exploring a bad action which we have confirmed in the past (bad luck!). To avoid such inefficient exploration, one approach is to decrease the parameter ε in time and the other is to be optimistic about options with <em>high uncertainty</em> and thus to prefer actions for which we haven’t had a confident value estimation yet. Or in other words, we favor exploration of actions with a strong potential to have a optimal value.</p><p>The Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) algorithm measures this potential by an upper confidence bound of the reward value, <script type="math/tex">\hat{U}_t(a)</script>, so that the true value is below with bound <script type="math/tex">Q(a) \leq \hat{Q}_t(a) + \hat{U}_t(a)</script> with high probability. The upper bound <script type="math/tex">\hat{U}_t(a)</script> is a function of <script type="math/tex">N_t(a)</script>; a larger number of trials <script type="math/tex">N_t(a)</script> should give us a smaller bound <script type="math/tex">\hat{U}_t(a)</script>.</p><p>In UCB algorithm, we always select the greediest action to maximize the upper confidence bound:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">a^{UCB}_t = argmax_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \hat{Q}_t(a) + \hat{U}_t(a)</script><p>Now, the question is <em>how to estimate the upper confidence bound</em>.</p><h3><span id="hoeffding-s-inequality">Hoeffding’s Inequality</span><a href="#hoeffding-s-inequality" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If we do not want to assign any prior knowledge on how the distribution looks like, we can get help from <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/extra-notes/hoeffding.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Hoeffding’s Inequality”</a> —- a theorem applicable to any bounded distribution.</p><p>Let <script type="math/tex">X_1, \dots, X_t</script> be i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) random variables and they are all bounded by the interval [0, 1]. The sample mean is <script type="math/tex">\overline{X}_t = \frac{1}{t}\sum_{\tau=1}^t X_\tau</script>. Then for u &gt; 0, we have:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{P} [ \mathbb{E}[X] > \overline{X}_t + u] \leq e^{-2tu^2}</script><p>Given one target action a, let us consider:</p><ul><li><script type="math/tex">r_t(a)</script> as the random variables,</li><li><script type="math/tex">Q(a)</script> as the true mean,</li><li><script type="math/tex">\hat{Q}_t(a)</script> as the sample mean,</li><li>And <script type="math/tex">u</script> as the upper confidence bound, <script type="math/tex">u = U_t(a)</script></li></ul><p>Then we have,</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{P} [ Q(a) > \hat{Q}_t(a) + U_t(a)] \leq e^{-2t{U_t(a)}^2}</script><p>We want to pick a bound so that with high chances the true mean is blow the sample mean + the upper confidence bound. Thus <script type="math/tex">e^{-2t U_t(a)^2}</script> should be a small probability. Let’s say we are ok with a tiny threshold p:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">e^{-2t U_t(a)^2} = p \text{  Thus, } U_t(a) = \sqrt{\frac{-\log p}{2 N_t(a)}}</script><h3><span id="ucb1">UCB1</span><a href="#ucb1" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>One heuristic is to reduce the threshold p in time, as we want to make more confident bound estimation with more rewards observed. Set <script type="math/tex">p=t^{-4}</script> we get <strong>UCB1</strong> algorithm:</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">U_t(a) = \sqrt{\frac{2 \log t}{N_t(a)}} \text{  and  }a^{UCB1}_t = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} Q(a) + \sqrt{\frac{2 \log t}{N_t(a)}}</script><h3><span id="bayesian-ucb">Bayesian UCB</span><a href="#bayesian-ucb" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>In UCB or UCB1 algorithm, we do not assume any prior on the reward distribution and therefore we have to rely on the Hoeffding’s Inequality for a very generalize estimation. If we are able to know the distribution upfront, we would be able to make better bound estimation.</p><p>For example, if we expect the mean reward of every slot machine to be Gaussian as in Fig 2, we can set the upper bound as 95% confidence interval by setting <script type="math/tex">\hat{U}_t(a)</script> to be twice the standard deviation.</p><p><em>Fig. 3.

The value of <script type="math/tex">\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)</script> is within the interval [0, 1]; α and β correspond to the counts when we <strong>succeeded</strong> or <strong>failed</strong> to get a reward respectively.</p><p>First, let us initialize the Beta parameters α and β based on some prior knowledge or belief for every action. For example, </p><ul><li>α = 1 and β = 1; we expect the reward probability to be 50% but we are not very confident.</li><li>α = 1000 and β = 9000; we strongly believe that the reward probability is 10%.</li></ul><p>At each time t, we sample an expected reward, <script type="math/tex">\tilde{Q}(a)</script>, from the prior distribution <script type="math/tex">\text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i)</script> for every action. The best action is selected among samples: <script type="math/tex">a^{TS}_t = \arg\max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \tilde{Q}(a)</script>. After the true reward is observed, we can update the Beta distribution accordingly, which is essentially doing Bayesian inference to compute the posterior with the known prior and the likelihood of getting the sampled data.</p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{aligned}\alpha_i & \leftarrow \alpha_i + r_t \mathbb{1}[a^{TS}_t = a_i] \\ \beta_i & \leftarrow \beta_i + (1-r_t) \mathbb{1}[a^{TS}_t = a_i]\end{aligned}</script><p>Thompson sampling implements the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_matching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probability matching</a>. Because its reward estimations <script type="math/tex">\tilde{Q}</script> are sampled from posterior distributions, each of these probabilities is equivalent to the probability that the corresponding action is optimal, conditioned on observed history.</p><p>However, for many practical and complex problems, it can be computationally intractable to estimate the posterior distributions with observed true rewards using Bayesian inference. Thompson sampling still can work out if we are able to approximate the posterior distributions using methods like Gibbs sampling, Laplace approximate, and the bootstraps.

In terms of the exploration strategies, we can do no exploration at all, focusing on the short-term returns. Or we occasionally explore at random.
